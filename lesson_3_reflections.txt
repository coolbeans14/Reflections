When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you're collaborating with another person, or want to make your work accessible
    to other people through the internet; or if you just want a backup of your work
    on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you don't find your code changing when you aren't around or in
    unexpected ways.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones are just copies of a repository in another place. Forks are the same
    as clones, but the origin and created repository are both on Github. Branches
    are a split in the development of the repository itself, which can have
    different code/functionality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
